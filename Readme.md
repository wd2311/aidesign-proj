## Smart Meal and Grocery List Planning

The main goal of the project is to present optimized grocery lists keeping in mind the budget, dietary restrictions and nutritional 
requirements of individuals. 

The model uses a two-stage architecture : Candidate Generation, that selects a list of recipes with maximum ingredient overlap, followed by Candidate Ranking, that generates the list of recipes ultimately shown to the user and selected based on nutritional diversity.

The main app can be run through `back-end/app.py`.

Instructions for running locally:
